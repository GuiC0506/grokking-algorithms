# BigO Notation 

Given that an algorithm is tested on "n" elements, BigO notation provides how many operations that algorithm takes to get to the target "n" element.
Based on this number of operations, this algorithm can be considered slow or fast.

Notation: O(n), where n is equal to the number of operations

Simple search: linear exection-time -> O(n)
Binary search: logarithmic execution-time -> O(log n)
